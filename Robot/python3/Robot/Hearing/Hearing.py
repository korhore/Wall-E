    Process basic functionality is validate meaning level of the sensation.
    We should remember meaningful sensations and ignore (forget) less
    meaningful sensations. Implementation is dependent on memory level.
    
    When in Sensory level, we should process sensations very fast and
    detect changes.
    
    When in Work level, we are processing meanings of sensations.
    If much reference with high meaning level, also this sensation is meaningful
    
    When in Longterm level, we process memories. Which memories are still important
    and which memories we should forget.
    
    TODO above implementation is mostly for Hearing Sensory and
    Moving Sensory and should be move to those implementations.
