Architecture of Robot-project
-----------------------------

Goal is to implement world of most human-king Robots. We use structure of human.
Huhan is basec on cells that will be born undedicated but will be dedicated to
their special duties. This project does not implement cells, but higher structure,
organs.

We use python in our projects, because it is language of science and has
most capabilities of modelling things.

Robot
-----

Robot implements method 

    def process(self, transferDirection, sensation):

meaning that Robot can process Sensation. Robot runs rorever

        while self.running:
            if not self.getAxon().empty() or not self.canSense():
                transferDirection, sensation = self.getAxon().get()
                self.process(transferDirection=transferDirection, sensation=sensation)
            else:
                self.sense()


Sensation
---------

Sensation is only data that Robot can have from the real world. There are two
types Robot Muscle and Sense. We must also implement transferDirection to guide
Robot to what Axon-direction to transfser Sensations.

Sense-type Robots produce Sensation(s) same way as humans senses do.
They tranfer Sensation up, so transferDirection is Sensation.TransferDirection.Up.

Muscle-type robots implement Robots functionaly to real worls likea speking or moving.
In pactioce some Robot.instance will wan't some functionality to happen -
decicion is make bases on sensed thing, just like humans do - it will create
a Sensation where transferDirection is Sensation.TransferDirection.Down and
Muscle type Robot will get that Sensation and perform functionality wanted.

Most meaningfull parameters of Sensation are
  - SensationType
    What Kind od Sensation this is, for instance Image, Voice, Item etc.
  - MemoryType
    MemoryType is either Sensory, Work of LongTerm. Sensory-type Robots
    produce Sensory-type Sensations. If Sensory-type SEnsation should be processed
    like for instance Images are to Work-type Robot does the job and produces
    Work-type Sensations, for instance Item. Seeing is so process,
    there Robot uses its 'brains' as humans do. Our Robot concept mimics humans
    there it can. We have also Robos thast are interested of Sensory-type Sensations
    and produce actions. When Robot find out for instance that human beeing is neaby
    it starts to communicate.
    if MemoryType is LongTerm, this means that Robo wants to remeber this Sensation
    for a long time. Sensory-sensation live only short time, because Sensory
    Sensations processing should be very fast. Work Sensations longer, so they
    can be processed and this processing can take some time.
  - RobotType 
    RobotType is either Sense or Muscle. for instance If Sensation SensationType
    if Voice and RobotType is Sense, this means that Robot has heard a Voice.
    If RobotType is Muscle, this means that Robot wants to speak this Voice.

To transfer Sensation(s) we need Axon(s).

Axon
----

Axon can tranfer Sensation between Robots. Each Robots has Axon. Robot is connected
to its technical owner with Axon. This forms 1:n technical relationship.
If Robot don't have owner, is is called MainRobot. Even thouugh all Robot-instances
have MainRobot capabilities - if needed, every Robot can behave as MainRobot
in our Robot-network - all Robotrs know their role and MainRobot will own Memory.

Memory
------

Memory is collection of Sensation connected with each other with Association(s).
Memory implements remebering. Robot can rfemenber what has been happned. As
human, also with Robot capability to remember will need capability to forget
things, because as human memory, memory can not be unlimited.

Asociation
----------

Association connects two Sensations with some parameters ans one is Feeling.

Feeling makes our Robot human like. Our Robot can fall io9n love, ve afraid etc.
Our Robot seaches love so feeling guides behaviour of the Robot. If hates to be
afraid, so it does to wan't to do things that mekes it to feel afraid.

Config
------

Robot-instances are in practice derived class instances of Robot-class
with different kind duties and copabilities. Each Robot has
<robot-name>/etc/Robot.cfg -file that defines its capabilities. This file defines
exacly what kind of Sensation(s) Robot-instance is interested of.

We must also implement transferDirection to guide Robot where to
