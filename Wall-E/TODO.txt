- convert to python3, because we wiil use Tenserflow in picture classifying
  and perhaps in other tasks also and TenserFlow does not work very well
  with python2.7 with raspberry, but with python3 better
  
- import problem

- arrange code by copabilities as modules without denpendencies: moving,
  hearing, seeing, sensing, etc. This can solve import problem,
  but it would be aesier to develop capabilities anyway.
  
  - OK CONFIG_FILE_PATH from config.py
  - OK sensation length cleaner in socketclient, maybe format string
