  but it would be easier to develop capabilities anyway.
  
  - OK CONFIG_FILE_PATH from config.py
  - OK sensation length cleaner in socketclient, maybe format string
  - sensation length as bytee  in socketclient, tcp is bytes anyway
  - other possibility is toBuffer/toBytes - method to code sensation
    as bytes ans ecode method to oppisite way
