- OK convert to python3, because we wiil use Tenserflow in picture classifying
  and perhaps in other tasks also and TenserFlow does not work very well
  with python2.7 with raspberry, but with python3 better
  
- OK import problem

- arrange code by copabilities as modules without denpendencies: moving,
  hearing, seeing, sensing, etc. This can solve import problem,
  but it would be easier to develop capabilities anyway.
  
  - OK CONFIG_FILE_PATH from config.py
  - OK toBytes - method to code sensation
    as bytes ans ecode method to oppisite way
    
 - Make Capabilities-class. Can be iplemented in Config. In confif should be
   anyway hosts, property, where we Aass hosts that have contacted us and
   hosts that we add manually. Start with this.
   
- Implement Identity and Virtual instance. That way we can test Walle to meet Eva
  in same process with threads, so developing will be much faster than using
  many physical servers, but functionality will be exactly same.
  Need some changes to Confif, Axen etc. Rename main class as Robot(Server)
  
  Weneed also functional status od robot, StudyOwnIdentity, Sleeping, Normal, etc
  
- Axon should have sunAxons with capanility and direction to handle sensation routing.
