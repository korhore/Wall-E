Wall-E Project
--------------

Introduction
-------------

Wall-E -project studies robots and controllers for them.
It is based on Adruino Pirate 4WD car, which carries Raprberry-PI to control it.
Remote controller is mobile phone like Android one or Maemo one or E7 ...
All parts are cheap and we use everything we allready own.

All devices are programmed with their own native programming language.

Arduino Pirate 4WD car
----------------------

Rore as Robot device, its "muscles"

This device is run by Romeo. Romea is Microcontroller and runs programs that are originally
written in C, compiled in host computer and uploaded by USB to the device. On this project we want
control Arduino by Parberry PI computer, which native programming language is Python, so we load
pyfirmata sketch 1) to it.

Raspberry PI
------------

Rore as Robot logic, it's "brains".

Raspberry PI computer is very small and very cheap. But is real computer running Linux.
We connect Raspberry PI and Arduino Romeo board by USB and set up Python server listening command
that come from WLAN from remote controller. We need a cheap WLAN USB-stich.
Python has fine libraries to read WLAN connections and handle serial line devices
that Romeo is seen in USB connection. Raspberry PI has two USB connection and we use them both, but we don't need
USB-HUB.

N900
----

Role as remote controller

N900 is maemo mobile phone which runs Linux. It's native programming language is Qt C++, which is ideal to make
applicatyions with graphical UI and WLAN-client. We study fancy logics how to control devices, so this as fine
platform to make them.

Android Phone
-------------

Role as remote controller

Android Phone's role is same than N900, we can use it as remote controller. Android is programmed by Java and it has fine graphic libraries
and it can use WLAN connectios. Unfortunately nothing is programmed fot Android yet, that time I haven't got yet.
